## Hi there! 👋

I’m Sebastian, an IT professional transitioning into a career as a Cloud Architect with a strong focus on Microsoft Azure, AI, and Security. With 3+ years of experience in software development, IT consulting, and Android UI engineering, I’m now building on my technical foundation (Python, TypeScript, Kotlin, SQL, Flutter/Dart) by pursuing advanced cloud certifications (AZ-900, AZ-104, SC-900, AZ-305, AZ-500, AI-900, DP-100, AI-102, Terraform Associate).

My unique blend of business acumen (BBA in Marketing) and technical expertise allows me to bridge the gap between strategy and implementation — from designing secure, scalable architectures to helping businesses adopt cost-effective cloud solutions.

Currently, I’m:

🚀 Developing SaaS products like SkillCloudy (cloud certification prep) and SmartPDF.ai (AI-powered document automation)
🎯 Studying full-time to become an Azure Cloud Architect in the next 6 months
🤝 Exploring freelancing & consulting opportunities in Azure, AI, and cloud security

I’m also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer, passionate about knowledge sharing and building tools that empower others.

🔭 Currently learning: Azure Cloud, Terraform, and AI integration in SaaS
